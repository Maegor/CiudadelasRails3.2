    <strong>Introduction</strong><br/>

    Citadels is a card game of bluffing, deduction, and citybuilding for three to seven players.<br/>

    <br/>
    <strong>Object of the Game</strong><br/>

    <p>
        In Citadels, you and your opponents play the leaders of rival cities increasing their prosperity by building new
        districts.
        The game ends after one player builds eight districts, and the players receive points based on what districts
        they have in their
        cities. The player with the most points wins.</p>

    <br/>
    <strong>Cartas de Distritos</strong><br/>

    <p>These cards represent the various districts that you can add to your city. Each district card has a cost,
        represented by a number of gold coins along the card's left edge. In order to put a district card into play, you
        must pay its cost in gold. </p>
    Each district card also has a color in the bottom left corner, which tells you what type of district it is:<br/>

    <strong>Character Cards</strong><br/>

    <p>These cards represent the leaders of the players' cities. Each character card has a rank number from 1 to 8.</p>

    <br/>
    <strong>Setting up the basic game</strong><br/>
    <ol>
        <li>Shuffle the eight (or nine) character cards together into one deck. This is called the Character Deck.</li>
        <li>Shuffle the district cards together into one deck. This is called the District Deck.</li>
        <li>Deal each player four random district cards from the District Deck..</li>
        <li>Each player receives two gold from the bank.</li>
        <li>A player choosen randomly receives the Crown.</li>
    </ol>

    <br/>
    <strong>Playing the game</strong><br/>

    <strong>Step One: Remove Characters</strong><br/>

    <ul>
        <li> Draw one card from the Character Deck and set it aside, face-down in the center of the table, without
            looking at it.
            This card will not be used this round.
        </li>

        <li> Draw up to three cards (depending on the number of players, see below) from the Character Deck and set them
            aside face-up. These cards will also not be used this round..<br/>
            <span style="font-size:smaller">If you draw the King or the Emperor card to be set aside face-up, immediately replace it with another card from the Character Deck, then shuffle the King or Emperor back into deck.</span>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <br/>
    <table id="tabla_descartes">
        <tr>
            <th>nº of players</th>
            <th>nº of face-up cards</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>3</td>
            <td>3</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>4</td>
            <td>2</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>5</td>
            <td>1</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>6-7</td>
            <td>0</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <br/>
    <strong>Step Two: Choose Characters</strong><br/>

    The player who has the Crown takes the Character Deck and secretly chooses a character. He then passes the remaining
    character cards to the player on his
    left, who also chooses a card, and passes the remaining cards to the left. This continues until each player has
    chosen one card from the Character Deck.
    The last player chooses from the two remaining cards, and places the last card face-down in the center of the table.<br/>
    <br/>
    <strong>Step Three: Player Turns</strong><br/>

    once each player has drawn a character card, the player who has the crown calls out the names of each of the
    char-acters, in the order of their rank
    numbers. (He first calls out "Assassin" (#1), then "Thief" (#2), and so on.) If none of the players has a given
    character, the player with the crown
    moves onto the next character.<br/>

    When the name of your character card is called, you must reveal your character card, place it face-up in front of
    you, and take your turn. When your
    turn is over, the player with the crown calls the name of the next character card. In this manner, play proceeds in
    the order of the character cards.
    On Your Turn<br/>

    <strong>1)</strong> Take an Action: At the beginning of your turn, you must either<br/>
    <br/>
    &bull; take two gold from the bank,<br/>
    &bull; or draw two district cards from the District Deck, choose one to put in your hand, and put the other on the
    bottom of the deck.<br/>
    <br/>
    <strong>2)</strong> Build a District Card: You may build one district card into your city (that is, play it from
    your hand onto the table in front of you). In order to do so, you must pay the cost of the district, in gold, to the
    bank. You may choose not to build a district card if you wish.<br/>
    You may never have two identical districts (two castles, two markets, etc.) in your city.<br/>
    Each character also has a power. You may use your character's power once during your turn. (The powers of each
    character are summarized on their cards and detailed at the end of these rules. Be sure to familiarize yourself with
    the detailed powers before playing.)<br/>


    <br/>
    <strong>Step Four: End of Round</strong><br/>

    After all the characters have been called, the players return their cards to the Character Deck, which is shuffled, and a new round begins.<br/>

    <br/>
    <strong>Game End</strong><br/>

    When a player builds an eighth district, the players finish the round. The game ends at the end of that round. At the end of the game, each player receives points as follows:<br/>

    &bull; Points equal to the total costs of all the districts in a player's city<br/>

    &bull; + 3 points if a player has districts of each of the five colors<br/>

    &bull; +4 for the first player to build eight districts<br/>

    &bull; +2 for each subsequent player to build eight districts<br/>


    <br/>

    <br/>
    <strong>Seven-player Game</strong><br/>

    During the "Choose Characters" step of a seven-player game, when the seventh player gets one character card from the sixth player, he also takes the face-down discarded card. He then chooses one of these two cards and discards the other one, face-down.<br/>
    The same is applied to eight players with a ninth character.<br/>
